# Weather-Dashboard-App

## Description

Given a Weather-Dashboard-App Project, I used JavaScript to make a Weather Dashboard website where you can check for the weather in any city. It will display the Current weather data of the city along with a 5-day forecast. The data which will be displayed is a city name, date, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. Also, it will save the city input on a 6-button history memory. The history will stay there all the time even if you refresh or reopen the page because it is stored in local history.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this Weather-Dashboard-App, open the website link, click on search input and enter a city name (if you want to be more precise insert similar to example: "Essex,uk" where uk is use the specific country code) then click search and it will provide you with the city's weather information today and 5-day forecast. If you need to check again on a city is on your history you can click the button with the name of the city to show again the weather information.
